To cite the Pulsar in publications, please use:

...wait the Pulsar is unpublished. I guess just use the source code URL for
now.

I do hope to work on an Pulsar publication in the next couple months
however, though I am completely clueless about how to approach
this. If you have any advice on this please help me out.

Should I do a application focused methods paper on some Galaxy-P tools
that would not otherwise be usable in Galaxy without the Pulsar geared at
proteomics researchers, should I do a short application note about the
technical aspects of the Pulsar? Both? Combine concepts into one paper
with two audiences?  What journal(s) should I target? Thanks!
